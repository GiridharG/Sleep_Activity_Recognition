Sleep Activity Recognition using Bangle.js 1

This repository contains a Sleep Activity Recognition App developed for the Bangle.js 1 smartwatch. The app tracks sleep activity based on scores and threshold values and displays a sleep report.

Additionally, we attempted to train an LSTM model using a synthetic dataset (heart rate, accelerometer data, and sleep labels). The trained Keras model was converted to TensorFlow Lite format, with the goal of further converting it to JavaScript for on-device inference on Bangle.js 1. However, this final conversion was unsuccessful, and the attempt is documented in the Jupyter Notebook included in this repository.
